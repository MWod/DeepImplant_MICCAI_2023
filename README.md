# DeepImplant - MICCAI 2023
This repository will be soon updated with the inference code for the paper entitled:
"High-Resolution Cranial Defect Reconstruction by Iterative, Low-Resolution, Point Cloud Completion Transformers"
accepted for the MICCAI 2023 conference.

Unfortunately, due to the grant agreement we cannot release the full framework that is under development.
